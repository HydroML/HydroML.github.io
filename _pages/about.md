I am a second year PhD student at the University of British Columbia under the supervison of [Ali Ameli](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/aliameli) and under the co-supervision of [Elina Robeva](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~erobeva/). My current research interests span many areas of Earth and statistical sciences including catchment hydrology, causal discovery, information theory, feature importance/selection, machine learning, and AI fairness.

Want to collaborate?

I keep a list of papers that I find interesting and would like to expand upon in future work in the 'interesting papers' tab. If you also find any of these papers interesting and would like to collaborate, feel free to send me an email anytime.
