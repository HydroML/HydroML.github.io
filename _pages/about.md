I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia under the supervision of [Ali Ameli](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/aliameli) and under the co-supervision of [Elina Robeva](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~erobeva/). My current research interests span many areas of Earth and mathematical sciences including catchment hydrology, causal discovery, information theory, feature importance/selection, machine learning, game theory, and AI fairness.

Want to collaborate?

I keep a list of papers that I find interesting and would like to expand upon in future work in the [Favorite Papers tab](https://hydroml.github.io/FavoritePapers/). If you also find any of these papers interesting and would like to collaborate, feel free to send me an email anytime.
